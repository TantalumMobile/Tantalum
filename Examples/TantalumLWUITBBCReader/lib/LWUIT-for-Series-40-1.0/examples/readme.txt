LWUIT for Series 40 example applications
========================================

This folder contains twelve example applications:

LWUIT_Birthdays, LWUIT_CategoryBarDemo, LWUIT_GesturesDemo, LWUIT_ListDemo, LWUIT_Puzzle, LWUIT_TouristAttractions, and RLinks are demo applications that show how to use various Series 40 features. They have been initially published at Nokia Developer.

LWUITBrowser, LWUITDemo, Makeover, and Tipster are modified from the LWUIT 1.5 package. LWUITDemo has been optimised to Series 40. The other applications are mostly unmodified. 
The project structure of the original these projects has been simplified to make building process easier. They are meant for the MIDP target only.

ContactBookDemo is a simple project that is also described in the Getting Started section.
