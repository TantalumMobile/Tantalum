/**
 * A
 * <code>Task</code> is the base unit of work in Tantalum. It is a single unit
 * of work executed on a background worker thread pool. The thread pool pulls
 * <code>Task</code>s from a common queue.
 *
 * Each
 * <code>Task</code> is
 * <code>fork()</code>ed and executed only one time after which it is discarded
 * or passed as a value object.
 * <code>Task</code>s receive an input value. During execution this value is
 * mutated into an output value which is from that point immutable.
 *
 * Each
 * <code>Task</code> is a functional programming "function" for asynchronous
 * concurrent fulfillment on a background thread pool. In other functional
 * programming platforms the function filled by
 * <code>Task</code> is known as a "future" (C++ 11 stdlib) or a "promise"
 * (JavaScript frameworks such as RX). All asynchronous
 * <code>Task</code>s can be converted for synchronous usage by calling
 * <code>get()</code> which will block until execution completes.
 *
 * Any piece of code which runs in response to an event and does not explicitly
 * need to be run on the user interface (UI) thread is usually implemented in an
 * extension of
 * <code>Task.exec()</code>. It will automatically be executed on a background
 * worker thread once
 * <code>fork()</code> has been called.
 *
 * A
 * <code>Task</code> which has
 * <code>Task.UI</code> will, after successful completion on a background worker
 * thread, be forked to the platform's UI Thread after successful completion.
 * The UI Thread will then call their
 * <code>run()</code> method for synchronous, serialized interface updates.
 *
 * A
 * <code>Task</code> is often an anonymous inner class extending
 * <code>Task</code> and adding a lambda expression (bit of asynchronously
 * executable code). Such inner classes are closures and exhibit lambda capture
 * (convenient reference access to final values in the outer scope). Since inner
 * classes maintain an object reference to their parent instance, the outer
 * scope parent can not be garbage collected until the Task completes. In cases
 * where rapid heap memory release is critical and the outer scope is holding
 * large objects that should be freed before the Task executes or completes, a
 * named static inner class may be more suitable.
 *
 * Long running
 * <code>Task</code>s may periodically check their status to see if
 * <code>cancel(false, "reason")</code> has been signaled. They can be stopped
 * instantly by calling
 * <code>cancel(true, "reason")</code>.
 * <code>Task.exec()</code> code which may be canceled should utilize
 * <code>try {..}finally{..}</code> to clean any associated resources.
